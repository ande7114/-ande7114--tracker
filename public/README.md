## DECO2017 Web Design Prototype Description
    "Create a functional web app that handles data according to the proposed model in your design. This will involve leveraging your understanding of web technologies to ensure that the application is able to handle the required user interactions and data inputs. The backend of the application will be developed using JavaScript for a minimal web server, while the frontend will be developed with a combination of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. To ensure that the application's code is of the highest quality, you will need to follow best practices for coding, including writing well-formatted and well-commented code that is easy to read and understand."

This web app prototype is a music journal that assists users in tracking the music they have listened to while on trips, holidays etc. The app uses a calendar system to help users navigate which days have been logged with a journal entry.

## Justifications, Iterations, Improvements and Reflections

- Had a hard time integrating a calendar feature 

Looking through various tourism microsites for inspiration, I noticed that a lot of the websites implemented a minimimalist design and I wanted to incorporate that design trend in my prototype. Many websites I looked through barraged the user with a lot of information and different links to sections of the site and I felt overwhelmed by the sheer information that was available. Wanting to take a minimalist approach I incorporated a very simple and clean UI to increase user readability and accessibility. 

Made a few adjustments based on the previous assignment's feedback. One of the feedback made from the marker and through user testing results was that the text paragraph width was too wide and inconsistent between the 5 different pages. To fix this I centered both the images and text to the middle and added padding on both the left and right side of the web to increase readability for larger displays.

I also changed some of the background images due to resolution issues and contrast clashes with the navigation bar text clashing with the background images. I went through multiple iteration choices for the header/background images for the webpages and I chose images that I felt suited the purpose of the page. These changes were applied to the home page and gallery page. The home page in particular was chosen for its design patterns of framing, color and plane. As the homepage background, the shot of the multiple red torri gates going down a singular path/plane welcomes the user to explore the website and the composition of the image helps frames the user's mindset in such a way. 

Another change from the mockup design of my website is the change of the "Gallery & Comments" to just "Gallery". This was done as feedback showed that tested users were confused by the title and I felt it distracted away from the true purpose of the website which is to provide information on the tourist destination.

An added feature I implemented was an underlining the subpages when a user hover over the sub-page links. 

I struggled a lot with incorporating a lot of the CSS styling as I encountered a lot of bugs due to clashing code and wasn't able to incorporate all the ideas from paper to the final prototype. Moving forward I will need to gather a deeper understanding of the different ways to align and position html elements using css and incorporating responsive design.
